 Api Gateway is a basic security enriched feature that is simple to use and operate under. `Api Gateway` module is the edge microservice operated under node.js and `student-records` is the target api / product api.
 Designed with simple security measures, currently it is ideal to use for a sample scenario. As we build on top of it, api gateway should align close to the implementation of an actual project with security in mind.
 All comments and suggestions are openly welcome.

## Basic Installations

Currently, the project is built with :

1. node, express, axios. ` npm i node express axios`
2. helmet for basic application security. `npm i helmet`

 ## QuickStart

Built with simple ideas and logic in mind, the project is also an attempt to be user friendly. The quickstart of this guide includes `npm install` and running the scripts based on `package.json`.

## Architecture

The architecture is based on Node.js as a service, with an integration of DB system ( Not yet decided ). Api gateway is only an edge microservice that is designed with security and ease of access in mind.

## Questions or Help

We are committed to a loosely-coupled architecture and would love to assist you in the usage of the application itself. If you would like to request features or support please email the team.
